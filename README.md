1. How many lines are drawn each frame? In other words, how often does the for loop run?
   A line is drawn every 10 units from x=10 to width-10, and the width=400, so there are 39 lines. 

2. What do the first, second, and third appearances of the number 10 do in the code?
   A line is drawn every 10 units from x=10 to width-10
